# Neovim Configuration
This is the Neovim configuration I'm currently using. I recently started using Neovim and want to begin with a basic setup. This will be a work in progress for a while. Who knows, maybe I'll switch to Neovim completely in the future.

## Installation
1. Install Neovim
1. Clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`
